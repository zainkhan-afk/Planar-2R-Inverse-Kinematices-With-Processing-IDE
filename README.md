# Planar-2R-Inverse-Kinematices-With-Processing-IDE
The code is written in processing IDE. The code contains a 2 joint arm in a 2D space. The end point of the arm follows the mouse pointer around. As the mouse position is changed on the screen, the joint positions of the arm are changed so taht the end point of the arm always points to the mouse pointer.
The notes that were used in making this example are given [here](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~anima/408/Notes/Kinematics/InverseKinematics.htm).
